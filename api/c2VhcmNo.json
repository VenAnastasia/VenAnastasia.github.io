If…should doIf + S. +过去式，S.+ could/should/would，此句型用来表示与现在事实相反的假设，if从句要用过去式，主从句用“过去式助动词 + V.”。如果政府官员按他们承诺的那样落实保护环境的措施，那我们的环境早就应该会更好的。If government officials implemented measures to protect the environment as they promised, our environment should have been better.\n如果家长们愿意倾听孩子的想法，给他们足够多的关注，那这些孩子就不会犯罪。If parents were willing to listen to their children’s ideas and give them enough attention, these children would not commit crimes.\n3. Just as…, so…本句型用来比较两相似的情况，as引导状态状语从句，so也作副词用，表示“也是”，之后接从句，或将主语与主动词对调形成倒装。(Just) as + S. + V.,so + S. + V.(Just) as + S. + V.,so + 助动词 + S.正如我们不会把垃圾丢到我们自己家客厅一样的地板上一样，我们也不应该在公共场所乱丢垃圾。Just as we would not throw garbage on our living room floor, so we should not litter in public places.\n正如我们自己希望得到理解那样，孩子也一样。Just as we hope to be understood, so do children.\n正如我们渴望与外面世界时时刻刻保持紧密联系一样，老年人也渴望。Just as we are eager to stay in close contact with the outside world, so are the elderly.\n正如你希望自己的意见被合作伙伴尊重，对方也一样，所以平等、友好、真诚的沟通是一切合作的基础。Just as you want your opinions to be valued by your partners, so do other people. Therefore, I believe that equality, friendship and effective communication are the foundation of all cooperation.\n4. no more…, thanno more...than句型表面上看起来是表示不同的比较，但实际上是表示同等关系，用来强调“两者均不……”。现在的孩子并没有比几十年前的孩子了解更多性知识。Today’s children do not know more about sex than children decades ago.\n即使被高科技应用包围，现代人并不比以前的人幸福多少。Even if surrounded by high-tech applications, modern people are no more happy than people in the past.\n一个没有新鲜空气的城市不能称之为家园，就像没有食物的草原不能称之为栖息地。A city without fresh air is no more a home than a grassland without food is a habitat.\n没有自由的教育和没有灵魂的身体一样，都是不可持续的。Education without freedom is no more unsustainable than a body without a soul.  \n没有相互理解的合作就跟没有交流的婚姻一样，都是不长久的。Cooperation without mutual understanding is no more long-lasting than a marriage without communication.\n5. now that…now that引导原因状语从句，用来说明某人决定做某事的理由，通常是对方已知的讯息。既然环境已经快速恶化，我们还有什么理由不行动起来。Now that the environment has deteriorated rapidly, we do not have any reason not to act.\n考虑到现在已经有很多人沉迷游戏不能自拔，高科技产品最后会把我们奴役的可能性是存在的。There is a possibility that high-tech products will eventually enslave us, now that many people are addicted to online games.\n考虑到现代人的工作压力越来越大，心理问题越来越该被重视。Now that the work pressure of modern people is getting higher and higher, mental problems should be paid more and more attention.\n考虑到很多孩子对学校里的课程并不感兴趣，教育者应该根据儿童的实际需求设计更有趣味性的课程。Now that many children are not interested in the school, it is true that educators should design more interesting courses based on children’s need.\n6. so that…S. + V. + so that + S. +助动词+ V.，该句型中so that引导的从句用来表目的，从句中常出现can, could, will, would, may, might等助动词，在口语中that可省略。电影和电视应该减少对暴力的宣扬，这样青少年不至于被误导。Movies and TV shows should reduce the promotion of violence so that teenagers will not be misled.\n现代人要注意自己的饮食习惯，不要摄入太多的脂肪，这样才能保持身体健康。Modern people should pay attention to their eating diets and do not consume too much fat, so that they can maintain good health.\n在与他人合作的过程中，彼此要做到互相尊重，这样合作才是有效的。In the process of working with others, mutual respect must be guaranteed, so that cooperation is effective.\n对环境的保护绝不能停留在喊口号的阶段，而是应该有实际的行动，这样我们就能呼吸到新鲜的空气，迟到没有污染的食物。To protect the environment, we should not simply talk the talk, but should walk the walk, so that we can breathe the fresh air and eat uncontaminated food.\n7. so…that…so + adj./adv. that + S. + V.，此句型用来表示“如此……以致于（有……结果）”。信息技术变革的步伐如此之快，以至于那些不愿欣然接受变革的人远远落在了后面。The pace of change in information technology is so rapid that it leaves those who do not readily embrace the change far behind.\n普通人对成功是如此的渴望，结果为了达到成功愿意牺牲很多事情，甚至包括自己的良知和健康。Ordinary people are so eager for success that they are willing to sacrifice many things, even including their conscience and health.\nso + adj./adv.移到句首时，主要从句的主语与be动词或主动词必须倒装。我们的环境保护太没有成效，以至于我们被污染的河流和污浊的空气所包围。So inefficient is our environmental protection that we are surrounded by polluted rivers and dirty air.\n我们对青少年心理健康的关注太少，所以很多人不知道青少年为何要犯罪。So little do we pay attention to the mental health of adolescents that many people do not even know why teenagers commit  crimes.\n8. the more…, the more…the more + S. + V., the + 比较级 + S. + V.，该句型如果more后面跟的都是形容词，可以写成这样：电子设备的画面越生动，沉溺于虚拟世界的人就越多。The more vivid the picture of the electronic device (is), the more people indulge in the virtual world.\n如果动词为be动词，可以省略，可以写成：数据显示，工作节奏越快的人，身体状况越糟糕。Statistics show that the more faster the pace of work (is), the worse people’s physical condition (is).\n当然，可以把宾语提到more后面，让more直接跟名词。所以可以写成：家长让孩子自己做选择的机会越多，孩子的独立性越强。The more opportunities parents give their children to make their own choices, the stronger their independence (is).\n我们对环境问题关注地越多，政府会越快建立保护环境的法律法规。The more attention we pay to the environmental issues, the faster the government introduce laws and regulations to protect the environment.\n9. wheneverMark Twain说过这样一句话：Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to reform.每当你发现跟大多数人站在同一边时，就是改革的时候了。这个句子中， whenever是个连词，表示“每当，无论何时”，它可以引导时间状语从句。每当看到原本清澈的河水被严重污染，我就感到心碎。Whenever I see the once clear water is heavily polluted, I feel heartbreaking.\n每当孩子厌学时，家长和学校就该反思他们的教育方法。Whenever children are tired of learning, parents and the school should reflect on their teaching methods.\n每当我收到来自电商平台的包裹，我都控制不住为自己生活在数字时代而感到高兴。Whenever I receive a package from an e-commerce platform, I can’t help but feel happy about living in the digital age.\n当你睡不着觉的时候，你可以听一些音乐或者喝一杯热牛奶。Whenever you cannot fall asleep, you can listen to some soft music or drink a glass of hot milk. \n","thumbnail":"https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/11/19/MgwlrR.md.jpg","plink":"https://venanastasia.github.io/2019/11/19/sentence05/"},{"title":"Array & String","date":"2019-11-14T10:45:48.000Z","date_formatted":{"ll":"2019年11月14日","L":"2019/11/14","MM-DD":"11-14"},"author":"Hard-working Anastasia","updated":"2020-01-19T14:01:42.618Z","content":"Array & String\n\n\n1. 数组Tips: (1) 在算法竞赛中，常常难以精确计算出需要的数组大小，数组一般会声明得稍大一些。      (2) a[n++]=x;

V-ing / V-ed分词构句主要是由状语从句以及and连接的对等从句而来。表时间、原因、条件、让步的状语从句，其主语与主要从句相同时，可将主语省略并把动词改为分词，主动时用现在分词，被动时用过去分词。状语从句改为分词从句时，如果不造成句意混淆，可将连接词省略，我们以下面这个句子做示范：尽管政府还没有出台有效的保护环境的政策，但政府召集很多教授来开会讨论。Although the government has not introduced effective policies to protect the environment, the government has convened many professors to discuss the issue.\n因为两个分句里主语都是the government，所以第一步可以将although引导的状语从句改为分词从句：Although not having introduced effective policies to protect the environment, the government has convened many professors to discuss the issue.\n随后，因为although去掉后句意并没有明显影响，所以可以将although这个连词去掉，最后写成:Not having introduced effective policies to protect the environment, the government has convened many professors to discuss the issue.\n3. too…to-too + adj./adv. + (for sb./sth.) + to + V.，该句型带有否定意思，不定式前面可以加上for sb./sth.来表明对象。本句型的主语通常也是后接不定式的宾语，所以不定式后面不用再接宾语。比如：The water is too hot to drink it.这种表达是错误的，it应该被去掉，我们可以这么说：The water is too hot to drink.城市里的空气太差，以至于市民早上不能在室外跑步。The air in the city is too bad for people to run outdoors in the morning.\n科技发展得太快，以至于老年人跟不上它的步伐。Technology is developing too fast for the elderly to keep up with.\n老师布置的家庭作业太多学生完不成。The homework assigned by teachers is too much for students to finish.\n有些人太以自我为中心，以至于她们的伙伴没法与他们合作。Some people are too self-centered for their partners to cooperate with.\n","thumbnail":"https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/11/11/MMa8ot.md.jpg","plink":"https://venanastasia.github.io/2019/11/11/sentence03/"},{"title":"Iteration","date":"2019-11-11T02:04:44.000Z","date_formatted":{"ll":"2019年11月11日","L":"2019/11/11","MM-DD":"11-11"},"author":"Hard-working Anastasia","updated":"2020-01-19T13:59:13.776Z","content":"for, while\n\n\n1. for循环格式：for(初始化；条件；调整) 循环体;Tips：尽量缩短变量的定义范围。例如，在for循环的初始化部分定义循环变量。\n\n\n\n例题2-1 aabb:输出所有形如aabb的4位完全平方数。\n示例1：(7744)\n2-1 aabb(1)12345678910111213#include#includeint main(){\tfor(int a=1;a7)\n2-2 3n+1123456789101112131415#includeint main(){\tint n2,count=0;\tscanf(\"%d\",&n2);\tlong long n=n2;     //解决n=987654321溢出问题，一般比赛平台上int都是32位整数\twhile(n>1)\t{\t\tif(n%2==1) n=n\\*3+1;\t\telse n/=2;\t\tcount++;\t}\tprintf(\"%d\\n\",count);\treturn 0;}\n\n例题2-3 近似计算：\n示例：(0.785399)\n2-3 近似计算1234567891011121314#includeint main(){\tdouble sum=0;\tfor(int i=0;;i++)\t{\t\tdouble term=1.0/(i\\*2+1);\t\tif(i%2==0) sum+=term;\t\telse sum-=term;\t\tif(term","plink":"https://venanastasia.github.io/2019/11/11/for-competiton01/"},{"title":"Sentence Patterns 02","date":"2019-11-08T11:40:27.000Z","date_formatted":{"ll":"2019年11月8日","L":"2019/11/08","MM-DD":"11-08"},"author":"loving-English Anastasia","updated":"2020-01-19T13:26:57.283Z","content":"名词性从句\n\n\nHow does the book look like?\nHow to get one?Buy it!\n\n\n ´●_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ٩( ‘ω’ )و  get! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _●`\n1.

Good dental hygiene demands constant efforts, and failing to keep your month clean will make you suffer from poor oral health.【合作】Efficient teamwork demands each team member share their ideas as much as possible and do their best to achieve the common goal.【成功】If you demand more from yourself than anyone else could ever except, then no one can ever stop you from realizing your dreams. \n","thumbnail":"https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/10/28/KgnXAH.md.jpg","plink":"https://venanastasia.github.io/2019/10/28/writing01/"},{"title":"Beauty nereby","date":"2019-10-27T13:07:15.000Z","date_formatted":{"ll":"2019年10月27日","L":"2019/10/27","MM-DD":"10-27"},"author":"Happy Anastasia","updated":"2020-01-19T14:13:21.882Z","content":"Plants!\n\n\nFortunately, I got two plants at Charity sale after a volunteering.
